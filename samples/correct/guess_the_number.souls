hello ashen one

  traveling somewhere
  with
    const number of type humanity <<= 10,
    var r of type humanity <<= 0
  in your inventory
    while the r neq number covenant is active:
      traveling somewhere
        with orange saponite say @Your guess: @ \
        transpose into r \
        trust your inventory
          r eq number:
            traveling somewhere
              -- with orange saponite say @You got it!\n@ \
              go back
            you died
          -- liar!:
            -- traveling somewhere
              -- with orange saponite say @That's not it... Try again!\n@
            -- you died
        inventory closed
      you died
    covenant left
  you died

farewell ashen one
