hello ashen one

traveling somewhere
with
    var n of type humanity,
    var b of type humanity
in your inventory
    trust your inventory
        (n eq b) and (b + 1 lt n - 3):
            traveling somewhere
                n <<= 1 \
                b <<= n \
                n <<= n + 2 * 3 / b + 1
            you died
        liar!:
            traveling somewhere
                n <<= n + 1 \
                b <<= b - 1
            you died
    inventory closed
you died

farewell ashen one
