Module      : FireLink.BackEnd.RegisterAllocationProcess
Description : Register allocation algorithm by graph coloration
Stability   : experimental

Attempts to allocate registers by doing chaitan algorithm as described here:
https://cs.gmu.edu/~white/CS640/p98-chaitin.pdf

[@initialStep@] process all codeblocks as we have infinite registers. Also, on function calls,
all live variables at that moment are going to be "stored" before them. That is done to
avoid that the interference graph will have edges between their own variables.

Register allocation is made using optimistic colouring algorithm from Chaitan/Briggs

Data.Graph.Graph represents directed graphs, but we actually need undirected. So, we need
to remember that the existence of edge (i, j) implies that (j, i) exists (when i /= j)
